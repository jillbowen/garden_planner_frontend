# README

Welcome to your garden planner! This repository is the front-end. The back-end can be found here: https://github.com/jillbowen/garden_planner_backend

This single page app allows you to create a digital version of your garden to help you keep track of what's growing, and how to care for it.

After following the instructions on the back-end, open the index.html file and start adding plants!

NOTE: This app is meant for small container gardening, so each garden comfortably holds 6 plants.

Happy gardening!
